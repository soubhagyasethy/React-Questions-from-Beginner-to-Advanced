# Student time table

You are given a timetable of a class 12th student. You need to display the timetable of the student in the form of a table. The given timeTable data (check questionTimetable.html file) consists of objects of a particular day and each day consists of objects which show subject details across a particular hour.

Note: The starting period time is in hours. So think of a logic to fetch your current time in hours using JavaScript and display the data in the table accordingly.

You can see that class starts at 9 am and the last class is at 15 pm (which is actually 3 pm). The lunchtime is at 12 noon. Therefore there is no class at that time. Also, note that every lecture is of 1 hour.
